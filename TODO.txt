COMPLETED:
--Added variable 'vel_spts' in eles
--Added variable 'motion' in input
--Added variable 'motion' in eles
--Added method 'calc_alef_2D/3D' to flux.cpp

TODO (Short Term):
--Variable (array) to store velocity at flux points
--Method to interpolate velocity at shape points to velocity at flux points

TODO (Med Term):
--Implement mesh deformation (linear elasticity) for just triangles
--Create structure to call deformation script every xx iterations & update
  mesh info - Jacobian, anything else?  'Opp_x' matrices?

TODO (Long Term):
--Implement mesh deformation for ALL 2D elements
----Will it possibly involve converting quads to tris?
--Implement mesh deformation for 3D
